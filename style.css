ul li         {...}  /* a=0 b=0 c=2 -> specificity =   2 */
/* ul ol li      {...}  a=0 b=0 c=3 -> specificity =   3 */
/* li.red        {...}  a=0 b=1 c=1 -> specificity =  11 */
/* ul ol li.red  {...}  a=0 b=1 c=3 -> specificity =  13 */
/* #list         {...}  a=1 b=0 c=0 -> specificity = 100 */
